# arduinoPortfolio

This is a portfolio about a school assignment where we had to perform 6 different tasks with
the use of an arduino board and other small hardware parts.

## Usage
I personally used the Arduino IDE for the code, but any editor will do.
If you do not have an arduino, you can also go to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
For the materials used and videos of how I perfomred the tasks check de [pp](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OmdW7xukOtlPKdtX2jiAha5_q1VVuvqkBeWCW0txNQ4/edit?usp=sharing)
